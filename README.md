## Overview

Advent of Code is a series of programming puzzles released every day in December. This repository contains my Rust solutions to these puzzles. Each day's solution is organized in its own file in the bin directory, providing a clear structure to navigate through the code.
Data files for each day are located in the data directory e.g. data/1.txt for day1's input data, data/1t1.txt for day1's test data solution 1, etc.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Rust installed. You can download it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Running Solutions

Run specifix day's solution with:

```bash
cargo run --bin X
```

where X is the day number.

### Running Tests

Run all tests with:

```bash
cargo test
```

Or you can run specific day's tests with:

```bash
cargo test --bin X
```

where X is the day number.
